### In this class, I applied machine learning to address six problems.

* **Linear Regression**: Built a linear regression model using L1 and L2 regularization to predict second-hand car prices with an MSE of 5000, presented results to automotive stakeholders.
* **Logistic Regression**: Trained a logistic regression model with an AUC score of 0.85 to predict the effectiveness of a treatment, presented results to medical professionals.
* **K-means**: Applied K-means clustering to segment patient data into distinct clusters and visualized results with PCA, presented results to healthcare analysts.
* **CNN**: Created a CNN model for chest X-ray image classification, presented results to radiologists.
* **RNN**: Applied Naive Bayes and RNN models to classify emotions in Twitter data with 80% accuracy, presented results to social media analysts.
* **RNN**: Developed an RNN model for time series analysis to predict temperatures with an MSE of 3, presented results to meteorologists.
