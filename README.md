### In this class, I applied machine learning to address six problems.

* <ins>**Linear Regression**</ins>: Built a linear regression model using L1 and L2 regularization to predict second-hand car prices with an MSE of 5000, presented results to automotive stakeholders.
* <ins>**Logistic Regression**</ins>: Trained a logistic regression model with an AUC score of 0.85 to predict the effectiveness of a treatment, presented results to medical professionals.
* <ins>**K-means**</ins>: Applied K-means clustering to segment patient data into distinct clusters and visualized results with PCA, presented results to healthcare analysts.
* <ins>**CNN**</ins>: Created a CNN model for chest X-ray image classification, presented results to radiologists.
* <ins>**RNN**</ins>: Applied Naive Bayes and RNN models to classify emotions in Twitter data with 80% accuracy, presented results to social media analysts.
* <ins>**RNN**</ins>: Developed an RNN model for time series analysis to predict temperatures with an MSE of 3, presented results to meteorologists.
