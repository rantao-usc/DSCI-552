# DSCI-552
### In this class, I applied machine learning to address six problems.

* [Linear Regression](https://github.com/rantao-usc/DSCI-552/blob/main/Problem_Set_1.pdf): Built a linear regression model using L1 and L2 regularization to predict second-hand car prices with an MSE of 5000, presented results to automotive stakeholders.
* [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/rantao-usc/DSCI-552/blob/main/Problem_Set_2.pdf): Trained a logistic regression model with an AUC score of 0.85 to predict the effectiveness of a treatment, presented results to medical professionals.
* [K-means](https://github.com/rantao-usc/DSCI-552/blob/main/DSCI552_problem_set03.pdf): Applied K-means clustering to segment patient data into distinct clusters and visualized results with PCA, presented results to healthcare analysts.
* [CNN](https://github.com/rantao-usc/DSCI-552/blob/main/Problem_Set_4.pdf): Created a CNN model for chest X-ray image classification, presented results to radiologists.
* [RNN](https://github.com/rantao-usc/DSCI-552/blob/main/Problem_Set_5.pdf): Applied Naive Bayes and RNN models to classify emotions in Twitter data with 80% accuracy, presented results to social media analysts.
* [RNN](https://github.com/rantao-usc/DSCI-552/blob/main/Problem_Set_6.pdf): Developed an RNN model for time series analysis to predict temperatures with an MSE of 3, presented results to meteorologists.
